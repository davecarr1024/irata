## 🎉 Major Milestone: HDL Refactor Complete and Integrated!

I’ve finished a full refactor of the HDL subsystem into clean, mixin-based declarations with strongly typed component kinds. It’s now possible to define buses, registers, memory, and the CPU itself in terms of reusable, testable HDL component declarations. This unlocks high-confidence simulation verification and gives me a structured, declarative way to build the whole machine — no magic, no ambiguity, just real modeled hardware.

---

## ✅ Current State

### 🧠 HDL Subsystem

- The HDL type system is complete:
  - Component kinds are tracked with enums and type-safe base classes
  - Mixins like `RegisterWithReset`, `RegisterWithBus`, and `ComponentWithBus` make building new parts fast and accurate
  - Connected registers now carry bus relationships clearly (e.g., `RegisterWithWordBus` vs `RegisterWithByteBus`)
- I split HDL headers cleanly and removed the old `hdl.hpp` monolith
- I introduced a generic `ComponentWithBus` template to unify all bus-connected components under one shared interface
- Verification logic is structured and extensible per-component — each mixin declares its own `verify()` logic that walks and validates children
- Added fake components and fake component declarations for test isolation
- Unit tests now verify `ComponentDecl`, `BusDecl`, and full parent-child relationships including mismatches and hierarchy validation

### 🧠 DSL + Microcode Integration

- Components in the microcode DSL can now generically `copy()` from any bus-connected component to any other
- This enables writing real instructions (like `LDA absolute`) with total indifference to component internals — the DSL only cares about what bus each thing is connected to
- I can now express a full `read_memory_at_pc` in terms of component relationships alone

### 🧠 Simulation Integration

- The HDL type system is now fully connected to the sim layer
- Each sim component can now return a `ComponentType`, and the plan is to verify the actual sim structure against the HDL declarations
- `ProgramCounter`, `Memory`, and registers now follow the HDL mixin structure and will be validated using real HDL
- HDL verification will be a core test in the sim suite: it will ensure that the component tree is wired the way I intended, with no simulation-specific shortcuts

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Test suite now includes:
  - Standalone HDL component tests (including fakes)
  - `ComponentDecl` and `BusDecl` verification logic
  - DSL microcode execution
  - Instruction encoder validation
  - Controller ROM decoding
- Fake components allow testing HDL logic without full sim integration
- Tests ensure structural correctness and fail loudly on mismatch or misuse

---

## 🏗️ Actively In Progress

- ✅ Finalizing HDL `verify()` unit tests for core components
- 🔁 Refactoring sim-side `Control` and `Register` to use mixin-style structure like the HDL
- 🧱 Adding `CPU` and `Irata` shell components to the sim side
- 🔎 Adding `type()` overrides to all sim components to support HDL-based verification

---

## 🔜 Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Add `ControllerDecl` and `MemoryDecl` tests
- [ ] Implement sim-side CPU and Irata using HDL-defined structure
- [ ] Verify full sim tree in `IrataDeclTest`
- [ ] Build minimal `sim_runner` that loads a test cartridge and runs ticks
- [ ] Output serialized simulator state for golden test comparison

---

## 🔮 Longer-Term Plans

- 🧠 Expand instruction set and ROM cartridge support
- 💾 Add assembler pipeline and support for YAML-defined test ROMs
- 🔧 Improve sim runtime introspection for wires and buses
- 🐞 Add debugger or step-through support
- 🖥️ (Optional) Build GUI visualizer for educational value

---

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

- Declare everything. Fake nothing.
- Let HDL define intent. Let sim prove execution.
- Design for observability. Never hide the wires.
- Keep each layer testable and explainable.
- Write real instructions. Run real ticks. Build something that feels alive.

🚀 **The HDL is solid. The sim is verifiable. The instructions are real. I can now tick a modeled CPU through a real control cycle based entirely on declared structure and compiled microcode. I’m almost to the point of running real programs. It’s happening.**
