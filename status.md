# 🧾 Irata Project Status

_Last updated: August 4, 2025_

## 🎉 Major Milestone: Fetch Logic Fixed, Safe Merging Restored!

The microcode compiler now supports safe step merging by introducing **stage-aware logic** in the DSL and IR. A new `FetchStageValidator` enforces that **all instructions begin with the same canonical fetch-decode prefix**, regardless of opcode. With this fix, full-system simulation now runs reliably with step merging *enabled* — and instruction execution is rock solid.

## ✅ Current State

### 🧠 HDL + Simulation Unified

- HDL declarations (via mixins and component kinds) now fully match simulation components
- `Irata`, `CPU`, and `Memory` are constructed using real HDL intent and verified in unit tests
- Bus-connected components (like `ByteBus`, `WordBus`, `RegisterWithBus`) are cleanly represented and reusable
- The HDL verification system confirms that the sim component tree structurally matches expectations
- The entire `Irata` machine can now be driven in tests and produce logs from actual controller microcode

### ⚙️ Microcode + Execution

- Microcode is compiled from a clean YAML DSL
- The DSL now supports **explicit stage annotations** to group control steps (e.g., `stage: 0` for fetch)
- The compiler now respects stage boundaries during step merging
- A new validator ensures all instructions share an identical stage 0
- Execution proceeds correctly even if `opcode` is initially garbage
- ✅ HLT halts at 0x8001  
- ✅ LDA immediate loads 0x12 and halts at 0x8003  
- ✅ Step merging is now safely enabled and passing tests

### 🧪 Compiler Safety

- `FetchStageValidator` runs both **before and after merging**, enforcing that fetch logic is preserved
- Full unit test coverage for:
  - Mismatched control lines
  - Unequal stage 0 lengths
  - Truncated or extended fetch sequences
- Compiler will now fail hard on any structural inconsistency across instruction fetch stages

## 🛠️ In Progress

- 🧩 `irata_test.cpp` verifies multi-instruction programs tick-by-tick
- ✅ Step merging is re-enabled and protected by stage-based invariants
- 🧪 Continuing to expand test programs and microcode coverage
- 🧪 Planning more instruction additions: `STA`, `JMP`, `BRK`, etc.

## 🔜 Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Add more basic instructions and validate stage structure
- [ ] Build minimal assembler prototype from `.irata-c` to `irata-asm`
- [ ] Explore exporting microcode step traces for visualization
- [ ] Add richer HALT diagnostics and programmatic tick observers
- [ ] Begin defining memory-mapped devices and screen output

## 💡 Emerging Ideas

- 🧱 Rebuild sim component system with mixin-style features for clarity and power
- 🐍 Begin Python-side `irata/asm/py` support for reusable instruction definition loading
- 📦 Use editable `pip` install and unify Python tooling via root Makefile
- 🧰 Add `sim_runner` to load ROMs and dump serialized machine state for test harnesses
- 🔬 Write test that runs real `.irata` bytecode through controller-only trace

## 🧠 Philosophy Snapshot

> "Declare the machine. Simulate the intent. Test every wire."

Every layer of Irata now has a structural and testable contract. DSL logic, compiler passes, instruction fetch, and execution are all verified. There are no shortcuts — only wires and truth.

🔥 **The machine runs. The fetch is pure. The compiler has teeth. It’s beautiful.**
