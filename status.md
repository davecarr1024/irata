## 🎉 Major Milestone: HDL Refactor Complete and Integrated!

I’ve finished a full refactor of the HDL subsystem into clean, mixin-based declarations with strongly typed component kinds. It’s now possible to define buses, registers, memory, and the CPU itself in terms of reusable, testable HDL component declarations. This unlocks high-confidence simulation verification and gives me a structured, declarative way to build the whole machine — no magic, no ambiguity, just real modeled hardware.

---

## ✅ Current State

### 🧠 HDL Subsystem

- The HDL type system is complete:
  - Component kinds are tracked with enums and type-safe base classes
  - Mixins like `RegisterWithReset`, `RegisterWithBus`, and `ComponentWithBus` make building new parts fast and accurate
  - Connected registers now carry bus relationships clearly (e.g., `RegisterWithWordBus` vs `RegisterWithByteBus`)
- I split HDL headers cleanly and removed the old `hdl.hpp` monolith
- I introduced a generic `ComponentWithBus` template to unify all bus-connected components under one shared interface
- Verification logic is structured and extensible per-component — each mixin declares its own `verify()` logic that walks and validates children

### 🧠 DSL + Microcode Integration

- Components in the microcode DSL can now generically `copy()` from any bus-connected component to any other
- This enables writing real instructions (like `LDA absolute`) with total indifference to component internals — the DSL only cares about what bus each thing is connected to
- I can now express a full `read_memory_at_pc` in terms of component relationships alone

### 🧠 Simulation Integration

- The HDL type system is now fully connected to the sim layer
- Each sim component can now return a `ComponentType`, and the plan is to verify the actual sim structure against the HDL declarations
- `ProgramCounter`, `Memory`, and registers now follow the HDL mixin structure and will be validated using real HDL
- HDL verification will be a core test in the sim suite: it will ensure that the component tree is wired the way I intended, with no simulation-specific shortcuts

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Test suite now includes:
  - Standalone HDL component tests (with more coming)
  - Control line behavior
  - DSL microcode execution
  - Instruction encoder validation
  - Controller ROM decoding

---

## 🏗️ Actively In Progress

- 🔥 Removing the legacy `hdl.hpp` and updating all includes to new modular headers
- ✅ Finalizing HDL `verify()` unit tests for core components
- 🔁 Refactoring sim-side `Control` and `Register` to use mixin-style structure like the HDL
- 🧱 Adding `CPU` and `Irata` shell components to the sim side
- 🔎 Adding `type()` overrides to all sim components to support HDL-based verification
- 🔧 Building the `SimVerifier` that walks the sim tree and checks it against the HDL structure

---

## 💡 Design Wins

- ✅ Mixins are simple, expressive, and cover all behavioral contracts cleanly
- ✅ Buses are type-safe and there are no ambiguities about what connects where
- ✅ Microcode DSL uses structural relationships, not hardcoded names
- ✅ Sim structure is now inspectable, testable, and cross-verifiable from HDL
- ✅ The whole thing feels real — not like an emulated toy, but like a modeled machine

## 🔜 Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Remove `hdl.hpp` completely
- [ ] Finish and test HDL verification pass
- [ ] Add type annotations and verify all sim components against HDL
- [ ] Add `Irata` as sim root and wire up a bootable CPU shell
- [ ] Start executing real instruction flows through the whole pipeline
- [ ] Begin work on assembler and test ROM runner

---

## 🔮 Longer-Term Plans

- 🧠 Expand instruction set and ROM cartridge support
- 🔧 Add support for runtime logging and simulation replay
- 💾 Build assembler and test programs in YAML/DSL
- 🎛️ Expose control wires and runtime bus state for debugging
- 🖥️ Maybe a GUI for visualization down the line

---

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

- Declare everything. Fake nothing.
- Let HDL define intent. Let sim prove execution.
- Design for observability. Never hide the wires.
- Keep each layer testable and explainable.
- Write real instructions. Run real ticks. Build something that feels alive.

🚀 **The HDL is solid. The sim is verifiable. The instructions are real. I can now tick a modeled CPU through a real control cycle based entirely on declared structure and compiled microcode. I’m almost to the point of running real programs. It’s happening.**
