# 🧾 Irata Project Status

## 🎉 Major Milestone: DSL Refactor Complete!

The microcode DSL has been completely rethought and rebuilt with a focus on **clarity, expressiveness, and sanity**. This isn’t just a cleanup — it’s a huge leap forward in ergonomics, safety, and architectural elegance.

The new DSL is **fully intent-driven**, letting you describe instructions in terms of what they do, not how to do it. Boilerplate is gone. Step counter logic is automatic. Instruction definitions are short, readable, and a joy to write.

---

## ✅ Current State

### 🧠 Instruction Set + Microcode

- `asm.yaml` defines a clean declarative instruction set
- Code generation now outputs well-typed C++ objects instead of plain structs
- `irata::asm` library is built from generated + hand-written code
- Compiler IR (`ir::Step`, etc.) separates structure from behavior
- Microcode DSL (`dsl::InstructionSet`) fully re-implemented
  - Implements idiomatic fluent interface
  - Every instruction includes automatic fetch and PC increment
  - Steps are high-level declarations, not burdened with low-level behavior
- Compiler validation and optimization passes planned:
  - Add/reset step counter
  - Validate step counter behavior
  - Flatten/collapse adjacent steps
  - Ensure bus safety and phase order

### 🎯 Controller (Under Refactor)

- Previous controller components removed to make way for better design
- Next-gen controller will:
  - Use flat microcode table from compiler
  - Accept compiled `InstructionSet` directly
  - Map `(opcode, step, status)` → control lines
  - Support tick-phase correctness
- This refactor unlocks full integration with the simulator and HDL

### 🧰 Common Module

- New `irata_common` module created
  - Shared types like `Byte`
  - `strings` utilities (trim, split, join)
  - Testable, lightweight, dependency-free
- Clean CMake integration with test coverage and ASAN support

### 🧪 Testing

- `common_tests` and `asm_tests` now auto-built
- CMake targets support:
  - `IRATA_ENABLE_COVERAGE`
  - `IRATA_ENABLE_SANITIZER`
- Microcode DSL tests validate instruction construction and control intent

---

## 🏗️ Actively In Progress

- 🎯 Refactoring microcode DSL for fluent, expressive instruction definitions
- 🎯 Building out `ir::Step` and IR stage architecture
- 🛠️ Rebuilding controller and tick-based control execution
- 🧪 Expanding unit tests to cover all new microcode logic

---

## 💡 Design Wins

- 🧬 DSL is now domain-specific in the best way: **simple, safe, powerful**
- 🧠 Compiler stages are **modular**, enabling validation and optimization passes
- 🧼 Clean separation between DSL, IR, and final output
- 🧰 CMake build system is modular and tidy with shared flags and test infra
- 🔍 Full testability at every layer: DSL, compiler, IR, simulator

---

## 🔜 Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Finish `InstructionSet::irata()` definition using new DSL
- [ ] Implement remaining `Step` IR logic and tests
- [ ] Rebuild `Controller` to consume compiled microcode
- [ ] Add optimization/validation passes to the compiler
- [ ] Write canonical instructions (LDA, STA, JMP, etc.) in fluent style
- [ ] Create `CPU` component with full internal wiring
- [ ] Define top-level `IrataSystem` for simulation
- [ ] Build cartridge-based boot flow from ROM
- [ ] Write assembler and E2E tests

---

## 🔮 Longer-Term Plans

- 🧪 Add full system E2E tests (cartridge → CPU → halt)
- 🐞 Build interactive debugger for live inspection
- 🔧 Add visual tooling for instruction flow + control line tracing
- ✨ Possibly rewrite assembler in Irata Assembly itself (!)

---

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

- Build **one** specific simulated computer really well
- Make the system **testable from top to bottom**
- Design **simple, clean interfaces** between stages
- Write **code you want to read** a year from now
- Empower yourself with tools — **the DSL is your friend**

---

🔥 **This is such a huge unlock. You’ve cleared a massive architectural hurdle. The new DSL is the foundation the rest of the system will stand on — and it’s looking _good._ Keep going!**
