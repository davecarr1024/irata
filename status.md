# 🧾 Irata Project Status

_Last updated: August 3, 2025_

## 🎉 Major Milestone: Full-System Simulation Tick Verified!

The full `Irata` component — the entire computer — now ticks end to end using real microcode, real buses, and real hardware modeling. I verified that the system halts correctly when loaded with just a HLT instruction at address `0x8000`, and that the PC updates as expected. This is the first time the whole machine has run a "program" — and it worked!

## ✅ Current State

### 🧠 HDL + Simulation Unified

- HDL declarations (via mixins and component kinds) now fully match simulation components
- `Irata`, `CPU`, and `Memory` are constructed using real HDL intent and verified in unit tests
- Bus-connected components (like `ByteBus`, `WordBus`, `RegisterWithBus`) are cleanly represented and reusable
- The HDL verification system confirms that the sim component tree structurally matches expectations
- The entire `Irata` machine can now be driven in tests and produce logs from actual controller microcode

### ⚙️ Microcode + Execution

- Microcode is compiled from a clean YAML DSL
- The system properly performs fetch-decode-execute cycles:
  - PC to address
  - Memory read
  - Opcode register update
  - Execution of instruction logic
- HLT runs successfully from real microcode
- Disabling step merging avoids fetch-decode corruption, so LDA also works now

### 🧪 TickUntilHalt Test Cases Passing

- ✅ HLT halts at 0x8001
- ✅ LDA immediate loads correct value and halts at 0x8003
- 🚨 Step merging caused controller corruption due to lack of stage boundaries — currently disabled

---

## ⚠️ Known Issue: Step Merging Bug

- Step merging currently causes invalid controller behavior due to merging fetch logic from unrelated instructions (like HLT) into the prefix of other opcodes
- Fix idea: introduce **`stage`** field in DSL steps (e.g., `fetch`, `decode`, `execute`) to restrict merging across conceptual boundaries

---

## 🛠️ In Progress

- 🧩 `irata_test.cpp` now tests full instruction programs tick-by-tick
- 🛑 Disabled step merging in compiler to ensure correctness
- 🧪 Starting to build more test programs to verify the controller and system behavior

---

## 🔜 Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Introduce `stage` concept to control step merging boundaries
- [ ] Re-enable and safely test step merging with stage-aware logic
- [ ] Add more basic instructions (`STA`, `JMP`, etc.) and verify correctness
- [ ] Finalize sim CPU internals using HDL-style declarations
- [ ] Start assembler prototype to compile programs from minimal syntax + YAML opcodes

## 💡 Emerging Ideas

- 🧱 Rebuild sim component system with mixin-style features for clarity and power
- 🐍 Begin Python-side `irata/asm/py` support for reusable instruction definition loading
- 📦 Use editable `pip` install and unify Python tooling via root Makefile
- 🧰 Add `sim_runner` to load ROMs and dump serialized machine state for test harnesses

## 🧠 Philosophy Snapshot

> "Declare the machine. Simulate the intent. Test every wire."

This project is finally what I wanted it to be — a structure where nothing is hand-waved, and where everything that's true in the HDL is testably true in the simulation. And it runs real programs.

🔥 **This was a huge milestone. The computer ran. And it was beautiful.**
