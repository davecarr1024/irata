## 🎉 Major Milestone: Controller Integrated with Real Microcode!

I’ve finished building out the controller and its integration with the compiled microcode system. It now drives actual control lines based on opcode, step, and status — fully compiled and fully test-verified. There’s no simulation trickery here: the control flow is driven by a real ROM structure that models hardware behavior exactly.

## ✅ Current State

### 🧠 Instruction Set + Microcode

- The instruction set is defined declaratively in `asm.yaml`, compiled into strongly typed C++ descriptors.
- The microcode DSL is expressive and clean, making it easy to write real instruction flows.
- I’ve implemented a robust IR and a full pass pipeline:
  - Validation passes for bus safety, step counter behavior, and status handling
  - Transformation passes to simplify and merge steps safely
- The result is a complete microcode table that can be directly loaded into the controller.
- Compiler passes are modular, test-backed, and cleanly structured.

### 🎯 Controller

- The controller is implemented as a compound component with no “magic” logic — it behaves like hardware.
- Control signal decisions are made by reading a simulated ROM: a 16x16 address space driven by opcode, status, and step index.
- It doesn’t peek at the instruction table or do any dynamic branching.
- It’s just pure bit-driven address decoding, just like it would be on a real chip.
- The controller exposes `tick_control()` which reads from the instruction memory and asserts control lines accordingly.
- Status values are collected from the real component tree and matched against precompiled combinations from the microcode encoder.
- The controller is fully tested with both branching and non-branching instructions, unknown opcode behavior, and status-driven control flows.
- No special cases. No backdoors. Just clean, simulated hardware.

### 🧰 Common Modules

- All the core types — `Byte`, `Word`, buses, control lines, and statuses — are shared, lightweight, and fully unit-tested.
- These form the glue between the compiler, DSL, and simulation.

### 🧪 Testing

- Test coverage includes:
  - Compiler pipeline (DSL → IR → Encoded Table)
  - InstructionEncoder and InstructionMemory behavior
  - Full controller simulation with live control wires
- Every failure gives readable, helpful errors.
- ASAN/UBSAN and gtest/gmock used across the board.

## 🏗️ Actively In Progress

- 🧪 Tuning controller test coverage and exploring validation options
- 🧠 Thinking through HDL-to-SIM verification strategies
- 🛠️ Building out more real instructions in DSL for a full `irata::InstructionSet::irata()` set
- 🧱 Starting to draft the top-level `CPU` component

---

## 💡 Design Wins

- ✅ The controller doesn’t get “help” — it just decodes ROM based on register values
- ✅ Opcode/step/status resolution works the same way it would in a hardware PLA
- ✅ The test suite is readable, expressive, and realistic
- ✅ Full isolation between compiler logic and simulation logic
- ✅ I can write real instructions and trust they’ll do what I wrote

## 🔜 Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Finish controller HDL verification strategy
- [ ] Hook up PC and step counter into the CPU shell
- [ ] Add boot and halt behaviors
- [ ] Wire together top-level system test that ticks a real program
- [ ] Continue expanding instruction set and test cartridges

## 🔮 Longer-Term Plans

- 🧠 DSL editor with validation and autocomplete
- 🕹️ Bootable cartridges and interactive test programs
- 💾 Assembler for compiling test programs into RAM
- 🔍 Visual inspection tools for runtime control and bus state
- 📜 Export logs or traces for analysis

---

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

- Don’t fake hardware — simulate it as faithfully as possible
- Every bit should flow from a source I wrote and can test
- Errors should be meaningful and readable
- The compiler and the simulator are two sides of the same coin — but they never cheat
- Let the system stay transparent and traceable, even at scale

🚀 **I’ve got a real hardware-modeling controller running off real compiled microcode. This is a huge leap forward — I can now start modeling real instructions, ticking real programs, and layering in the rest of the system. The microcode subsystem is no longer just theoretical — it’s *working*. Let’s go!**
