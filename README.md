# ðŸŽ® Irata

**Irata** is a handcrafted 8-bit virtual computer system â€” a personal exploration of retro hardware design, compiler internals, and full-stack simulation. Inspired by machines like the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64, Irata is not just a project, but a philosophy: clarity, modularity, and joy in building every layer yourself.

The name comes from "Atari" spelled backwards, pronounced "errata" â€” reflecting its nostalgic roots and playful, homebrew inversion.

## ðŸ§  What Is Irata?

At its heart, Irata is a complete virtual computer platform with:

- A custom C-like systems language
- A 6502-inspired assembly layer
- A fast interpreter for execution
- A signal-level hardware simulator
- A cartridge format and loading system

It is designed not for performance, but for **understanding** â€” where every instruction, signal, and tick is inspectable and teachable.

## âœ¨ Project Philosophy

Irata is built on a few core beliefs:

- **Vertical craftsmanship** â€” Build the whole stack, know what each piece does  
- **Playful clarity** â€” Prioritize readability, creativity, and clean interfaces  
- **Tactile simulation** â€” Make hardware feel physical, even in code  
- **Modular composition** â€” Design systems that can grow, split, and recombine  
- **Whimsy encouraged** â€” Itâ€™s a fake console with real heart

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Create a vertically integrated 8-bit computer system
- Explore compiler design through a simple systems language
- Simulate hardware using bus-level, microcoded control flow
- Support writing, loading, and executing real programs end-to-end
- Build tools for inspecting, visualizing, and understanding the system

## ðŸ“š Who It's For

This project is for you if:
- Youâ€™ve ever wanted to write a game for a console that doesnâ€™t exist
- You enjoy reading signal waveforms more than marketing docs
- You believe software can be joyful, deliberate, and beautifully weird

---

## ðŸ§ª Current Modules

Irata is (or will be) implemented in modular components, including:

- A custom C-like compiler
- A 6502-inspired assembler
- A signal-level simulator (`chuu`)
- CLI tools and test harnesses
- A growing set of programs, tests, and cartridges
